   What's up guys! My name is Vikram Chandran, and I am currently a sophomore at UC Berkeley. I'm originally from Los Angeles where I was really into swimming and debating. I was exposed to comptuer science during high school, so I decided to try it out at UC Berkeley for fun and see where it takes me. Currently, I am pursuing a major in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, and potentially minoring in Data Science major whenever it is released!

   My family and I are really into traveling. We usually try to go to India every year to visit my grandparents and other relatives, and we try to go abroad as often as possible. I'm also a really big fan of food in general-except spicy food. My favorite desert is a chocolate volcano cake, and my favorite non-desert meal is Brazilian Churrascaria, which is basically just a lot of meat. Other than that, my favorite video game would probably be Assassin's Creed and my favorite T.V. show is currently WestWorld on H.B.O. I'm also really into ping pong as a side hobby. Hope you guys have a great day!
